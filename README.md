Integrated with [TimePad](https://welcome.timepad.ru/) API, it allows you to:

* Subscribe to other TimePad users and get notifications about the tickets they've bought;
* Find the best events (locally or worldwide, today or all-time);
* View the most popular events for a given keyword;
* Remember events that you've planned to visit.
